# Forecasting Future Car Prices Using Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to accurately predict car prices using a comprehensive dataset. The goal is to provide quick, data-driven insights for dealerships and consumers by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The system incorporates various attributes such as mileage, model year, transmission type, and brand to forecast car prices reliably.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project and run the scripts, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip. Follow these steps:

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is sourced from GitHub and made available by user SripathiVR. It includes historical car pricing data from multiple countries, featuring various attributes such as:

Model Year: The year the car was manufactured.
Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled.
Brand: The brand of the car (e.g., Toyota, Ford).
Transmission Type: The type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
Fuel Type: The fuel type used by the car (e.g., petrol, diesel).
This dataset is intended to help in developing machine learning models for predicting car prices based on the features mentioned.
